Daily menu provides facilities for canteen management.

== Description ==
Daily menu is designed for canteen management, or other restaurant in which you want to focus one particular menu per day. In the administration side, create several dishes that you will use later to compose your "daily menu". Once this step is done, create day-to-day menus
Insert the following shortcode to dynamically show the menus of the week : [dm_menu period=week].
You can also add a wiget on your slide bar with the menu of the day, or the coming next menu, if it is 4 PM or after.  

Here are the coming next functionalities:
*	a comprehensive page of general options to handle subtypes, css styles, language, etc.
*	more options to the dm_menu shortcode
*	handling of multi-menu per day

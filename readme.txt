Daily menu provides facilities for canteen management.

== Description ==
Daily menu is designed for canteen management, or other restaurant in which you want to focus one particular menu per day. In the administration side, create several dishes that you will use later to compose your \"daily menu\". Once this step is done, create day-to-day menus
Insert the following shortcode to dynamically show the menus of the week : [dm_menu period=week].
Here are the coming next functionalities:
 - a widget to show today\'s menu
